{N/A} [Joe: Folded arms wondering / cara1-17]
#Message#
These guys are \C[2]Sara Chidouin\C[0]
and her best friend \C[2]Joe Tazuna\C[0].
They're a pair of dweebs who waltzed together
into the Death Game, all friendly-like!
##

#Message#
Without having a clue what was what,
their \C[2]First Trial\C[0] began, and they cleared lots more...
##

#Message#
And they chose to cooperate and survive
with all the other participants.\|\|
##

#Message#
But their cooperation was for naught!
And high school teacher \C[2]Kazumi Mishima\C[0] died.
##

[Nao: Tired half-closed eyes / cara7-19]
#Message#
His ex-student \C[2]Nao Egokoro\C[0] went into
this hilarious panic over it, see.
##

#Message#
So the self-described homemaker \C[2]Kai Satou\C[0]
made use of that to instigate her...
##

[Sou: Looking down to side, annoyed / cara5-20]
{SE: se_maoudamashii_magical14}
#Message#
And she stole back the laptop that job-hopper
\C[2]Sou Hiyori\C[0] got his hands on!
##

#Message#
The laptop concealed proof that Kai
was colluding with the organization.
##

[Kai: Looking down and to side, sweating nervously / cara8-12]
#Message#
Ultimately, Kai died in the \C[2]Main Game\C[0].

All 'cause he grabbed the \C[3]Sage\C[0] card!
##

[Joe: Sweating bullets, eyebrows-up smile / cara1-20]
#Message#
And Joe, too, he got the \C[10]Sacrifice\C[0] card... and died.
##

[Joe: Hallucination (visible face) / cara1-25]
{SE: shock1}
#Message#
\C[10]Seems hallucinations started to eat away at Sara...
##

[Ranger: Smile sign / cara18-1]
#Message#
The second stage was the Sub-Game,
where everybody traded \C[2]tokens\C[0] amongst themselves.
##

#Message#
During all that, an AI of the dead Mishima showed up...
##

#Message#
And so did a fake doll that looked just like Reko!
It was one huge calamity.
##

[Q-taro: Touching cap, face in shadow, frown, sweat / cara4-9]
#Message#
Amid all that, \C[2]Q-taro Burgerberg\C[0]
discovered that laptop again.

He was nearing the heart of the Death Game, but...
##

[Sou: Disdainful pose, closed-eyes smile / cara5-12]
{SE: sceneswitch2}
#Message#
Lured by tokens, he handed the laptop over to Sou.

Man, ain't double-crossing just the best?
##

#Message#
Q-taro gathered the most tokens,
and \C[2]Gin Ibushi\C[0] didn't collect squat.

I was looking forward to one of 'em dying, but...

##

#Message#
It was \C[2]Alice Yabusame\C[0] who died in the end.

...Caught by my lies, in fact!

 It'll only hurt you, y'know?"

#Message#
What I didn't know... is that I'd be killed, too.
##
