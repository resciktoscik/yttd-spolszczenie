Where... is this place?
##

#Message#
\.Am I... inside my memories?
##

#Message#
\.Let's remember things one step at a time.
##

[Sara: Default (no collar) / cara0-1]
#Message#
This is me.

My name is \C[2]Sara Chidouin\C[0].
##

[Joe: Default (no collar) / cara1-1]
#Message#
It all began when I was coming home from school
with my friend \C[2]Jou Tazuna\C[0].
##

#Message#
Suddenly, a stalker appeared...
We ran in fear of being attacked, and arrived home.
##

#Message#
But someone was lurking there,
and knocked us unconscious.
##

#Message#
We woke up in an unfamiliar room.
##

[Sara: Default / cara0-2]
#Message#
Tied to beds and with collars put on us,
we were forced to solve a puzzle for our lives.

That was... the \C[2]First Trial\C[0].
##

#Message#
Waiting for us after we got through the trial
were 9 people of varying age, gender, and occupation.
##

#Message#
Still not knowing what was what,
we all cooperated to escape this place,
and evaded traps trying to take our lives.
##

#Message#
But...
##

[Miley: Default smile / cara14-1]
#Message#
Due to an unfair move from the suddenly-appearing
Floor Master - \C[2]Sue Miley, the Laughing Doll\C[0]...
##

#Message#
Professor \C[2]Kazumi Mishima\C[0]... died.
##

[Alice: Default glare / cara11-1]
#Message#
We also met up with a murderer who had been hiding,
\C[2]Alice Yabusame\C[0]...
##

[Miley: Smug smile / cara14-6]
#Message#
And began a vote with our lives at stake...
The \C[2]Main Game\C[0].
##

#Message#
Two cards decided our fates...
The \C[3]Sage\C[0], and the \C[10]Sacrifice\C[0].
##

[Kai: Looking down and to side, furrowed brow shout, sweating / cara8-13]
#Message#
The ones who had them were...

\C[2]Kai Satou\C[0], my stalker who held
some sort of key to the Death Game, and...
##

[Joe: Sweating bullets, forced smile / cara1-19]
#Message#
My best friend... Joe.
##

#Message#
And so Joe was killed... in the cruelest of ways.
##

#Message#
In my crumbling heart... someone's voice echoes.
##

[Kai: Holding up bleeding wrists, smile / cara8-9]
#Message#
\C[4]"I entrust them to you... Our regrets, our hopes."
##

#Message#
There... my senses gave out again.
