#Message#
Gin Ibushi
A somewhat cheeky grade-school boy
who ends his sentences with "woof" and "meow."
##

#Message#
\.He seems to have gotten attached to me,
calling me "big sis Sara." His positivity in this
uneasy situation is very unlike a grade-schooler.
##

#Message#
\.But I don't know how Gin's mental state
might change from seeing a tragedy happen before him.
...Even I've never seen such a horrible thing before.
