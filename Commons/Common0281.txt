#Message#
Sou Hiyori
A self-described job-hopper.
A timid man who speaks with a smile.

\.He's slender and might be pretty weak,
considering he couldn't even open a sliding door.
On the other hand, he made a sudden change
when I picked up the gun... It was a little scary.

#Message#
\.For Russian Roulette, Sou was left outside the room.
I'm curious about the "secret room" he mentioned
finding while we were dealing with that.
