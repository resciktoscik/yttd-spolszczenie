{Nao} [Nao: Holding wrist, looking toward camera / cara7-9]
#Message#

 feel more safe with than you, Sara."
##

[Nao: Holding wrist, looking down / cara7-5]
#Message#

 It'd be a little scary..."

 It'll probably be boring to learn about..."
##

 There should be no risk for either of us."
##

[Nao: Angry eyebrows, mouth open / cara7-20]
{SE: Accent28-1}

\."Besides, if you don't want me looking, Sara...
 I wouldn't even think of checking it out."
