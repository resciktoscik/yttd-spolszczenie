"Like Nao says!
 She couldn't open the door to the kitchen!"

{Kai}
#Message#
\."And neither could I. In fact, the kitchen key
 was \C[2]beyond the iron bars on the second floor\C[0], yes?"
##

#Message#
\."I did not go to the second floor.
 How do you explain the key's presence there?"
##

{Sara}
#Message#
"That's it! There were iron bars
 just up the stairs from the first floor!
 The key was thrown through the gaps!"
##

{Kai}
#Message#
\."Is that so? I understand..."
##

#Message#
\."However, supposing I guided miss Nao to the kitchen,
 do you believe I could threaten her?"
##

{Sara}
#Message#
"If she wasn't threatened, why would Nao hit Sou?!"
##

{Kai}
#Message#
\."I would love to know that myself."
##

{Sara}
#Message#
\.\C[4](Urk... No good...!)
##

#Message#
"Maybe there was some conflict between Kai and Sou!"
##

{Kai}
#Message#
\."There is nothing."
##

{Sara}
#Message#
\.\C[4](I can't prove it...!)
##

#Message#
"Kai... He did this to cause discord between us!"
##

{Kai}
#Message#
\."Do you have proof?"
##

{Sara}

\.\C[4](Urgh...!)
