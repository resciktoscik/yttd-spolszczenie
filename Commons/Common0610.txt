\.Middle-class, born and raised by a very
ordinary family. School grades below average.
Focused on art starting in high school,
and now seems interested in pursuing only that.
##

\.Looks up to an art club advisor she met in high school,
staying deeply intimate with him even post-graduation.
Often seen going to the man's atelier.

##

{Documents}
#Message#
\.Doesn't appear to have many friends,
but has a long association with most she does have,
so it's suspected she values relationships.
##

#Message#
\.Also, refrains from going out at night,
generally staying at home even on days off.
##

#Message#
\.No information known on what men she associates with.

<身体的な情報>

{Documents}
#Message#
Nao Egokoro
Age: 19
Gender: Female
Height: 162cm (5'4")  Weight: 55kg (121lb)
##

#Message#
\.Has little experience in sports and the like,
limited to P.E. classes in compulsory education.
Even so, her reflexes are poor.
##

#Message#
\.Perhaps due to her inclination toward art,
she has very good eyesight. Her ability to remember
a scene for a long time or recognize the individual
flaps of a bird's wings is within reason, yet superb.
##

#Message#
\.Since much of this comes from practice,
about the only thing that can be called a born talent,
it is thought, is her passionate love for art.
##

#Message#
\.No other notable characteristics,
although she has a large bust.

<デスゲームの情報>

{Documents}
#Message#
\.Safely cleared the First Trial.
Survived the first Main Game.
##

#Message#
\.Greatly affected mentally by death of her teacher.
Took off with teacher's head and ran amok.
##

#Message#
\.This could be taken as mental weakness,
but endurance of great shock could make her
that much more mentally sturdy going forward.

{Sara}
#Message#
\.\C[4](Nao isn't weak at all...)

#Message#
\.Most likely, Nao Egokoro treasures
the artworks she has created, and brushes et al.
received from her high school teacher.
##

#Message#
\.Due to minimal desire for money,
she does not seem the type to want expensive things.
##
