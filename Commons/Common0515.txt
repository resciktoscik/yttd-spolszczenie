\.\C[4](Yeah... She's not wrong about using an object.
 Maybe that item that's been mystifying me...!)

\."We noticed the trick to this because of

{Sara}
#Message#

 ...That's why the fragment could come off."

\."So it wouldn't be a good shield."

\.\C[4](But maybe she's sort of on the right track
 as far as using an object to help...)
