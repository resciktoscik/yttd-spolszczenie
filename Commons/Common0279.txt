#Message#
Kanna Kizuchi
A middle school girl. In the First Trial...
it seems she lost her big sister...
##

#Message#
\.Full of regret, she asked me about the First Trial.
Professor Mishima happened to be there and lied
out of concern for Kanna. I followed along.
##

#Message#
\.I hid the truth... because it was cruel.
But Miley called Kanna a sister-killer...!
Maybe Kanna resents me for hiding the truth...
Even though she sees her sister in me...
