\."...And so the discussion proceeds like that,
 and ultimately, a vote is held."

#Message#
\."In the story, you need to win votes about
 actions like "I wanna open this suspicious door!",
 thus you need to gain approval to cut a path."
##

#Message#
\."As for the essential voting system,
 I wasn't able to finish it in time."
(For now, I'm thinking something simple

#Message#
\."This ends the current mockup!
 Thank you very much for testing!"
