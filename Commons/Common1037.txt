"Those red areas of its body
 are making a crackling sound..."

\."Seems they're electrified or something.
 It'd be dangerous to touch."
##

[Keiji: Frown / cara2-2]
#Message#
\."The purple skeletal parts are some kind of armor.
 Probably okay to touch those..."
##

[Keiji: Default smile / cara2-1]
#Message#
\."...Might have to find a weapon
 or destroy the armor to deal with this one."

"Owww!! What fresh hell is that?!
 It zapped me good!!"

{Sara}
#Message#
\."Is it electrified...?!"
##

{Q-taro} [Q-taro: Fists balled, teeth clenched, sweat / cara4-6]
{SE: Accent21-1}
#Message#
\."Yeah...! Seems to be the red parts!
 Can't touch the shoulders or arms bare-handed!!"
##

{Sara}
{SE: Accent28-1}
#Message#
\."In other words... The armor isn't electrified!"
##

{Q-taro} [Q-taro: Fists-balled shout / cara4-5]
#Message#
\."Yep, you got it!
 Damn... Wish I'd noticed before I did that!"

"Owww!! The hell is this?!
 This thing's electrified!!"
##

{Sara}
{SE: Accent21-1}
#Message#
\."...Where did you just punch it?"
##

{Kurumada} [Kurumada: Frown / cara95-2]
#Message#
\."The shoulder, where else?!
 That sturdy armor ain't gonna break from a punch!"
##

{Sara}
#Message#
\."So then... It seems the red parts of its body
 have electricity running through them."
##

{Kurumada} [Kurumada: Grin / cara95-3]
{SE: Accent28-1}
#Message#
\."So no point in carelessly attacking
 anything but the armor, is what you're saying?"
##

[Kurumada: Mouth open / cara95-1]
#Message#
\."Shoulda noticed that before I punched it, dammit!"
