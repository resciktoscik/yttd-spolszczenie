#Message#
"You see, I decided with Reko
 that we'd trade 20 tokens each..."
##

{Reko} [Reko: Smile / cara6-4]
#Message#
\."But, y'know, gotta cross a shaky bridge together."
##

#Message#
\."For instance, we could pass 20 tokens like this,
 me to Sara to Nao..."
##

#Message#
\."Or pass 'em the other way, Nao to Sara to me."
##

#Message#
\."This way, we won't need to have
 extra trade partners in the future, see?"
##

{Sara}
#Message#
\.\C[4](So they're daring to trade them like this
 instead of an equal share...)

{Sara}
#Message#
\.\C[4](I'd like to receive tokens from
 those who want to amass them...)
##

#Message#
\.\C[4](I told Alice I would help him
 to collect Reko's tokens, but...)
##

#Message#
\.\C[4](And if you get 50 of someone's tokens,
 you can view their personal info, right?)
##

#Message#

 and which should I receive from?)
##

#Choice#
Give to Nao, receive from Reko
Give to Reko, receive from Nao
Don't trade
